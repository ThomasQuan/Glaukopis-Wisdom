Landing page created with the purpose of marketing our strategy and solution of helping businesses workforce during their furlough or layoff and beyond that in creation of a career improvement platform.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Our educational & job focused platform is coming together smoothly, with our team moving onward from innovation phase to entrepreneurship phase as our prototype is completed. Our developing website otherwise known as Glaukopis Wisdom started out as a central hub driven by ease of access to free educational resources but result in a makeover to future differentiate ourselves from our opponent. Thus, a single platform for job, educational resources search and community hub that specialize in helping each other was created.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>The process has expanded fittingly as we realized during the COVID-19 pandemic that a number of people are looking to improve upon current skills, learn entirely new ones, and most importantly utilize new wisdom and experience to secure and maintain stable employment, whether it be retaining a current job, or finding a new one. Not only do new skills and new opportunities go hand in hand, but alongside the recent tidal wave of online interactions, a community support forum of people wishing to do both at once made perfect sense. To put this ideal in display, Figma was introduce to the team as a wireframe & prototype tools to help achieve the visualization goal. As our Figma is being build daily, review from all members are also being conducted daily to help validate the prototype. This consistent build and review process were made only possible by the dedication and contribution of every team members to daily meeting, either it is a few minutes session or an hour-long review. As our prototype is finish and everyone approve of the design and marketing strategy, it is time to put it on the live version where everyone can view it and move on to the next phase - entrepreneurship.</p>

<h3> Next Step </h3>
<p>In terms of future steps, we are well aware that we are not the first/only 
search engine available for education or jobs. What we are aware of, is that 
this process can be streamlined, modified, and connected between users 
concurrently. Going forward we would like to expand the depth of our 
program selection, create stable relationships with hiring businesses, and 
perfect the Glaukopis Widsom Community forum, so that we can truly turn 
crisis into growth. All beginning from the comfort of your own home. “First 
stop Glaukopis Wisdom, next stop meaningful change.”
